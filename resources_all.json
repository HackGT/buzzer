After serving for eleven years in the Georgia House of Representatives, seven as Minority Leader, in 2018, Abrams became the Democratic nominee for Governor of Georgia, when she won more votes than any other Democrat in the state’s history. Abrams was the first black woman to become the gubernatorial nominee for a major party in the United States. After witnessing the gross mismanagement of the 2018 election by the Secretary of State’s office, Abrams launched Fair Fight to ensure every Georgian has a voice in our election system. Over the course of her career, Abrams has founded multiple organizations devoted to voting rights, training and hiring young people of color, and tackling social issues at both the state and national levels including Fair Count— to ensure that the 2020 Census is fair, accurate, and counts everyone.  She is a lifetime member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the 2012 recipient of the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award, and a current member of the Board of Directors for the Center for American Progress. Abrams has also written eight romantic suspense novels under the pen name Salena Montgomery, in addition to Lead from the Outside, formerly Minority Leader, a guidebook on making real change.  Abrams received degrees from Spelman College, the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, and Yale Law School. She and her five siblings grew up in Gulfport, Mississippi and were raised in Georgia.","link":null,"image":{"url":"/uploads/3115cb6372cf4564872be582d1252250.JPG"}}]},{"base":{"start_time":"2019-10-25T18:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2019-10-25T19:30:00.000Z","title":"Opening Ceremonies","description":null,"area":{"name":"Ferst Center Auditorium","mapgt_slug":"ferst_auditorum","capacity":970}},"people":[{"name":"Rahul Rajan","bio":"member","link":null,"image":null}]}],"faqs":[],"meals":[{"base":{"start_time":"2019-10-25T20:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2019-10-25T22:00:00.000Z","title":"Friday Dinner","description":"","area":{"name":"Klaus 1116W","mapgt_slug":"k_1116w","capacity":75}},"restaurant_name":"Lee's Bakery","restaurant_link":"https://www.facebook.com/LeesBakery/","menu_items":[{"name":"Chicken Vermicelli","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Tofu Vermicelli","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Veggie Spring Rolls","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Chicken Egg Rolls","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Pork Egg Rolls","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Grilled Pork Bahn Mi","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Chicken Bahn Mi","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Tofu Bahn Mi","dietrestrictions":[]}]},{"base":{"start_time":"2019-10-25T20:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2019-10-25T22:00:00.000Z","title":"Friday Dinner","description":"","area":{"name":"Klaus 1116W","mapgt_slug":"k_1116w","capacity":75}},"restaurant_name":"Quoc Huong","restaurant_link":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Quôc-Húóng/151864831504835","menu_items":[{"name":"Chicken Bahn Mi","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"BBQ Bahn Mi","dietrestrictions":[]}]},{"base":{"start_time":"2019-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2019-10-26T08:00:00.000Z","title":"Saturday Breakfast","description":null,"area":{"name":"Klaus 1116W","mapgt_slug":"k_1116w","capacity":75}},"restaurant_name":"Bagel Boys","restaurant_link":"http://bagelboyscafe.com/","menu_items":[{"name":"Bacon Breakfast Bagel","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Turkey Breakfast Bagel","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Turkey Breakfast Bagel","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Hummus Breakfast Bagel","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Hummus Breakfast Bagel","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Egg White Breakfast Bagel","dietrestrictions":[]}]},{"base":null,"restaurant_name":"Halal Guys","restaurant_link":"https://thehalalguys.com","menu_items":[]},{"base":null,"restaurant_name":"Grand Champion BBQ","restaurant_link":"http://www.gcbbq.com/","menu_items":[{"name":"Pulled Pork","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Smoked Chicken","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Mac N' Cheese","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Green Salad","dietrestrictions":[]}]},{"base":null,"restaurant_name":"Cafe Bombay","restaurant_link":"https://www.cafebombayatlanta.com","menu_items":[{"name":"Vegetable Samosa","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Channa Masala","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Chicken Tikka Masala","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Rice","dietrestrictions":[]}]},{"base":null,"restaurant_name":"Tea Top","restaurant_link":"https://www.teatopusa.com/","menu_items":[{"name":"Black Bubble Tea w/ Boba","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Black Bubble Tea w/ Lychee","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Green Bubble Tea w/ Lychee","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Green Bubble Tea w/ Grass Jelly","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Oolong Bubble Tea w/ Coconut Jelly","dietrestrictions":[]}]},{"base":null,"restaurant_name":"Flying Biscuit","restaurant_link":"https://flyingbiscuit.com/","menu_items":[{"name":"Chicken Sausage, Egg, & Cheese Biscuit","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Pork Bacon, Egg, & Cheese Biscuit","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Turkey Bacon, Egg, & Cheese Biscuit","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Chicken Sausage Scramble","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Tofu Scramble","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Soysage, Egg, & Cheese Biscuit","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Egg & Cheese Biscuit","dietrestrictions":[]}]},{"base":null,"restaurant_name":"Bao Bun Cafe","restaurant_link":"https://bao-bun-cafe.business.site","menu_items":[{"name":"Beef Scallion Pancake","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Chicken Scallion Pancake","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Tofu Scallion Pancake","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Pork Rice Bowl","dietrestrictions":[]}]},{"base":null,"restaurant_name":"TIff's Treats","restaurant_link":"https://www.cookiedelivery.com/","menu_items":[{"name":"Chocolate Chip Cookie","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Snickerdoodle Cookie","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Oatmeal Raisin Cookie","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Peanut Butter Cookie","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"M&M Cookie","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Sugar Cookie","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookie","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"White Chocolate Chip Almond Cookie","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie","dietrestrictions":[]},{"name":"Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie","dietrestrictions":[]}]}]}}
